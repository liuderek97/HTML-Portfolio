## Targert Audience 

The main target audience for this site are potential employees, collaborators or individuals who would like to learn more about my technology background and skills and personal portfolio.

## Tech Stacks Used

In order to complete and deploy this website I utilised the following tech stacks:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Netify; to deploy the live site
* Github

## Design Process

In order to come up with a design scheme for the site the following resources were used:
* Pinterest
* Khroma color picker
* trello 
* Balsamiq

### Pinterest

Pinterest is an social media application that allows users to upload and view images, as well as create a collection of images called "Pinterest Boards". Pinterest was employed to create a moodboard in order to gain inspiration for a web layout theme, as well as colour them. A moodboard was created and a number of thematically  similar websites were added to the moodboard to help narrow down the design scheme. After creating a moodboard Khroma was then utilised to select the colours.

### Khroma

Khroma is an online color pallete picker that allows for users to view a number of color palletes and gradients based on the user color preferences. Khroma was the main color picking pallete tool that was utilised in the design process, in order to come up with an aesthetic color scheme that fitted the desired theme. After using Khroma the following colours were selected to be used in the website:

### Trello

In order to keep on top of the Project a Trello board was created to ensure that each task and step of the design process was planned out and to ensure that each task had a deadline. When a task was created, a deadline was assigned to the specific task, the task status would then be updated or commented about if any progress had been made.

### Balsamiq

Balsamiq is wireframing tool that was employed during the plannnig stages of the project in order to create rough and schematic layout of how the website would look. Several wireframes were created using balsamiq and the wireframes created were representative of how the site would look. Wireframes were created for different devices such as desktop mobile and different mobile phone models. Balsamiq and the creation of wireframes was imperative to the design process as it provided a scheme to follow and a reference point for the styling of the site on different devices.
