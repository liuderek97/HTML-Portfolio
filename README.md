### Pinterest

Pinterest is an social media application that allows users to upload and view images, as well as create a collection of images called "Pinterest Boards". Pinterest was employed to create a moodboard in order to gain inspiration for a web layout theme, as well as colour them. A moodboard was created and a number of thematically  similar websites were added to the moodboard to help narrow down the design scheme. After creating a moodboard Khroma was then utilised to select the colours.
